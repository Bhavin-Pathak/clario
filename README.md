### OpenAI API Integration

Clario uses the OpenAI API to perform text summarization. The API key is entered by the user and stored in localStorage for development.

### API Call Example

The app makes the following request to summarize text:

```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a professional text summarizer. Create concise, well-structured summaries that capture the main points and key information from the given text. Keep summaries significantly shorter than the original while maintaining accuracy and clarity.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Please summarize the following text in 2-3 concise paragraphs, focusing on the main points and key information:\n\n${text}`,
    },
  ],
  max_tokens: Math.min(500, Math.floor(text.length / 4)),
  temperature: 0.3,
});
```

### Utility Methods

```javascript
// Summarize text using OpenAI API
await summarizeText(inputText, apiKey);
```
